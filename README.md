# [Project 1: Crimes Analysis and Visualization](https://github.com/Taiwooladapo/Crime-Analysis-and-Visualization-in-the-city-of-New-York/tree/main)
This is a project I did in my postgraduate degree to analyze and visualize crime rates in the city of New York in the United States of America.
# WORKFLOW
1. Retrieve the crime dataset from JSON file source.
2. Explore the dataset using the Python programming language.
3. Store the data in a MongoDB database.
4. Build an ETL pipeline using Luigi.
5. Save the pipeline results into a PostgreSQL database.
6. Utilize Jupyter Notebook to write queries in PostgreSQL for further visualizations.
7. Provide recommendations on reducing the crime rate based on insights derived from the data.
# TOOLS USED
1. Python
2. Luigi
3. MongoDB
4. PostgreSQL
5. Jupter Notebook
6. Docker
# LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK
One limitation of the project is the absence of machine learning algorithms to address high crime rates in New York City. Implementing such algorithms could be considered for future work to further enhance crime prevention strategies.
