# [Project 1: Crimes Analysis and Visualization](https://github.com/Taiwooladapo/Crime-Analysis-and-Visualization-in-the-city-of-New-York/tree/main)
This is a project I did in my postgraduate degree to analyze and visualize crime rates in the city of New York in the United States of America.
# WORKFLOW
1. Retrieve the crime dataset from JSON file source.
2. Explore the dataset using the Python programming language.
3. Store the data in a MongoDB database.
4. Build an ETL pipeline using Luigi.
5. Save the pipeline results into a PostgreSQL database.
6. Utilize Jupyter Notebook to write queries in PostgreSQL for further visualizations.
7. Provide recommendations on reducing the crime rate based on insights derived from the data.
# TOOLS USED
1. Python
2. Luigi
3. MongoDB
4. PostgreSQL
5. Jupter Notebook
6. Docker
# LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK
One limitation of the project is the absence of machine learning algorithms to address high crime rates in New York City. Implementing such algorithms could be considered for future work to further enhance crime prevention strategies.

# [Project 2: Investigation-of-socio-economic-factors-influencing-cancer-mortality-in-the-united-states](https://github.com/Taiwooladapo/Investigation-of-socio-economic-factors-affecting-cancer-mortality-in-the-united-states./tree/main)
This project was conducted during my postgraduate degree to develop a robust multiple linear regression model for predicting county-level cancer-related death rates. By utilizing demographic data and the incidence rate of cancer for each county, various regression models were explored to identify the most suitable one.
# Workflow Process
1. Utilized a cancer CSV dataset containing data from over 3000 US counties. 
2. Performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
3. Utilized a correlation matrix to examine the relationship between independent variables.
4. Removed outliers to improve prediction accuracy.
5. Verified the data against the predictions of the linear regression model.
6. Built the models using a stepwise regression approach.
7. Identified the second model as the most suitable one, which included an estimation of each predictor variable's coefficient, statistical tests of significance, measures of model fit, and diagnostic plots to evaluate the model's performance and underlying assumptions.
# Tools Used
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. R programming language
